    <h1>Origin of the Internet and the World Wide Web</h1>
    
    <p>&emsp;The Internet first started as an idea by J.C.R. Licklider in 1962. The idea was interconnected computers with everyone accessing data and programs from sites quickly and easily. Leonard Kleinrock, Lawrence G. Roberts, and colleagues connected a TX-2 computer to the Q-31 computer from Massachusetts to California and created a dial-up telephone line, being the first computer network created (Leiner et al 1997).</p> 
    
    <p>&emsp;Roberts then published the idea of the ARPANET in 1967. ARPANET worked towards connecting computer networks together until it grew into the Internet. The Internet began allowing resource sharing, Telnet allowing file transfer and remote login were a part of the very first (and expensive) computers. This also helped develop email which was the start of a new communication between society. As file transfer began developing further: File Transfer Protocol (FTP) became prevalent allowing smaller files to be accessed via the Internet (Leiner et al 1997).</p>
    
    <br/>
    
    <p>&emsp;The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. This invention was first thought of as an easier way to share information quickly. By using hypertext, he thought of a way to use the Internet to send information along with the ideas of HTML, URI, and HTTP. Tim then created the first web page editor and web browser: WorldWideWeb.app and went on to found W3C. Nicola Pellow then released Line Mode Browser which allowed the internet to be accessed by everyone for the first time (Connolly 2000).</p>
   
    <p>&emsp;Web browsers were a software application for sending, receiving, and displaying information on the World Wide Web. Hyperlinks helped navigate around these to get to different web pages The first hypertext browser 'Lynx' was created in 1992 and used Gopher to share information. Gopher was a TCP protocol which was at first an alternative to the World Wide Web until HTTP became prominent (McGinnis, 2001). Mosaic then became the most popular web browser which used FTP, NNTP, and Gopher. It was widely easy to use and was the first browser to support images with text and not having to open in another window (Connolly 2000).</p>
    
    <h2>Early Internet Technologies Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Email: Electronic mail was developed during ARPANET to exchange messages using the first computer networks. It began as early as the 1960s and 1970s, then converted to use by the Internet during ARPANET's shift into the Internet in the 1980s.</li>
        <li>Telnet: Developed in 1969, Telnet used TCP to connect one user on one computer to another computer that was on the same network. The security of Telnet was realized to be not secure and SSH was later favored for being more secure.</li>
        <li>SSH: Similar to Telnet, a secure channel allowing access to another computer in a not secure network. This replaced Telnet for it's better security by sending encrypted information so they cannot get intercepted.</li>
        <li>FTP: File Transfer Protocol transfers files between server and client on a network. It allowed usernames and passwords to connect and is used for developing desktop software, servers, mobile devices, hardware, and web page editors.</li>
        <li>HTTP: Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the baseline of sending and receiving data in the World Wide Web. HTTP uses hyperlinks to exchange hypertext and display webpages. HTTP/2 is the current version becoming standard in 2015.</li>
        <li>Gopher: A TCP protocol used before HTTP became prevalent. Developed by Mark P. McCahill using text menus on a hierarchical structure to provide wide-scale digital library connections. </li>
        <li>Browser: An application allowing a view of the Internet and web pages. Uses HTTP to get the information of a web page from web servers across the Internet. Mosaic was the first browser with a GUI.</li>
        <li>Lynx: Developed by students in the University of Kansas in 1992, Lynx was a customizable text-based browser. It used Gopher to share information and is the oldest web browser still active.</li>
        <li>Mosaic: Developed by the NCSA in 1992, released in 1993, Mosaic was the first popularized web browser with a GUI. It used FTP, NNTP, and Gopher to display webpages and was the first to display images inline with text.</li>
        <li>Hypertext: First thought of by Vannevar Bush as a way to view text on a computer screen. Memex by Bush was the idea of a device to digitally store peoples information using this hypertext. Webpages are written in Hypertext Markup Language (aka HTML) and is implemented all over the World Wide Web to share information.</li>
