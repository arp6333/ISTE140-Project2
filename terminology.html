    <h1>Terminology and Definitions</h1>
 <ul>
     <li>Internet: The Internet is the global connection of all computers in a network allowing sharing of most types of data digitally. Communications and connections between computers can happen regardless of hardware, location, and software.</li>
     <li>World Wide Web: The connection between Internet and User allowing a way to view files and documents on the Internet. Hypertext is used to display and search this information.</li>
     <li>Hypertext: First thought of by Vannevar Bush as a way to view text on a computer screen. Memex by Bush was the idea of a device to digitally store peoples information using this hypertext. Webpages are written in Hypertext Markup Language (aka HTML) and is implemented all over the World Wide Web to share information.</li>
     <li>Multimedia: Using more than one medium to communicate such as hypertext allowing audio and video to be intertwined.</li>
     <li>CLI: The command line interface is a way for the user to enter commands for their computer. The computer and user can communicate back and forth using this interface.</li>
     <li>GUI: The graphical user interface allows users to actually interact with their devices. Many visual indicators (buttons, tabs) allow the user to more easily read and access information besides just text and commands.</li>
     <li>HCI: Human-computer interaction is how people interact and use computers. We can attempt to simulate human behavior in a computer and allow users to have better experiences with technology.</li>
     <li>FTP: File Transfer Protocol transfers files between server and client on a network. It allowed usernames and passwords to connect and is used for developing desktop software, servers, mobile devices, hardware, and web page editors.</li>
     <li>SSH: Similar to Telnet, a secure channel allowing access to another computer in a not secure network. This replaced Telnet for it's better security by sending encrypted information so they cannot get intercepted.</li>
     <li>HTTP: Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the baseline of sending and recieving data in the World Wide Web. HTTP uses hyperlinks to exchange hypertext and display webpages. HTTP/2 is the current version becoming standard in 2015.</li>
     <li>Telnet: Developed in 1969, Telnet used TCP to connect one user on one computer to another computer that was on the same network. The security of Telnet was realized to be not secure and SSH was later favored for being more secure.</li>
     <li>HTML: Hypertext Markup Language is the system of displaying webpages in a browser. Text files can be customized to add color, background, font, and many other attributes which can be read by the browser to display however the user desires.</li>
     <li>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets are a way to describe and customize HTML attributes further than HTML can. CSS can also make HTML adapt to screen size, but it does not have to be used with only HTML.</li>
